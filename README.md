# Tick Tack Toe with Vue (CDN)

I just created simple tick-tack-toe using Vue imported from CDN.

This is just a sandbox. Please note that using the CDN version in a production environment is not recommended.

## Additional features
- Showing previous steps
- Going back to any steps
- Responsive style with tablets and phones (but not suited for wide screen)
