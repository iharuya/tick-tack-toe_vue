# Tick Tack Toe with Vue3 (CDN)

I just created a simple tick-tack-toe using Vue imported from CDN.

This is just a sandbox. Please note that using the CDN version in a production environment is not recommended.

At the time of coding this, the CDN source `https://unpkg.com/vue@next` is pointing to Vue3.

## Additional features
- Showing previous steps
- Going back to any steps
- Responsive style with tablets and phones (but not suited for wide screen)
